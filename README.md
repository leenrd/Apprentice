## Features

Enhanced Visibility and Control:

    - Track inventory levels across various locations (warehouses, stores).
    - Monitor product movement (inflow, outflow, transfers) for better stock control.
    - Identify low-stock items and trigger automated reordering to prevent stockouts.

Optimized Inventory Management:

    - Implement inventory forecasting techniques to anticipate demand and adjust stock levels accordingly.
    - Analyze inventory data to identify and optimize product placement, and reduce shrinkage (loss of stock due to various factors).
    - Reduce costs associated with overstocking, understocking, and obsolescence (expired or outdated products).
